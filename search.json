    "text": "Introduction\nI am a Graduate student at Virginia Tech specializing in 19th century history of Southwest Virginia and the New River Valley. As a native of Montgomery County, my focus began with an interest with my family’s history and genealogical research.\nI graduated in 2021 from Radford University with a Bachelors of History concentrating on the latter half of the 19th century. My undergraduate thesis focused on the lives of freedmen in Montgomery County and their economic opportunities.\nIn undergrad, I participated in several digital history projects. They are linked on this website if you’d like to learn more.\nProject #1\nIn the spring of 2020, the Covid-mester, my class for Digital History created an online exhibit that featured my great-grandfather, Dr. Ford K. Lucas. He was an Ensign in the Navy during the First World War.\nDuring his time deployed overseas in Europe, he wrote home to his mother, regaling his travels and expressing his wish to return home. This website includes the digitized letter, the transcription, and a family history.\nProject #2\nThe following spring when we returned to campus. I was once again in the Digital History class. This being my last semester before graduating, we decided to find a special project to end on.\nWhile browsing on Facebook, we were able to find a seller who had a collection of letters from 1890s Floyd and Pulaski Counties. Unsure of who these letters were from, the search began for a Mr. C.E. Bones and a Miss Lydia Conduff.\nAfter extensive Ancestry.com research we uncovered the two mystery lovers. Mr. Bones would go on to become Sheriff of Pulaski County. These letters were sent well before that when he was trying to court and marry Miss Lydia. The linked website project includes all the letters, transcribed, digitized, and annotated, along with a brief history and summary of the two.\nProject #3\nIn my first semester in Grad school, me and a cohort colleague were tasked with partnering with a Gloucester plantation called Fairfield. We researched the foodways present on the land that affected both enslaved and enslaver.\nThere were three major topics for this project, the first being a look into 19th Century Recipes. This gives context for the slave-holding class and their diets and cuisine for the time period.\nSecond, were three profiles on neighboring plantations, the efforts they had done to research their own foodways in connection to the enslaved, and the context of other sites located in Virginia.\nFinally, the prospect of excavations was put in the spotlight. Excavation and an archaeological site are the focus on much of the grounds at Fairfield. Because of their findings, my colleague was able to research some of the remnants found on the property in relation to the life of the enslaved and how the elites functioned.\n_______________\nMy work is displayed on this site for ease of public viewing."
