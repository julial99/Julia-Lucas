## Introduction

I am a Graduate student at Virginia Tech specializing in 19th century history of Southwest Virginia and the New River Valley. As a native of Montgomery County, my focus began with an interest with my family's history and genealogical research.

I graduated in 2021 from Radford University with a Bachelors of History concentrating on the latter half of the 19th century.
